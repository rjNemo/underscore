`underscore` is a `Go` library providing useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects.

It is mostly a port from the `underscore.js` library based on generics brought by `Go 1.18`.

## Usage

ðŸ“š Follow this link for the [documentation](https://underscore.onrender.com/).

Install the library using

```shell
go get github.com/rjNemo/underscore@0.4.0
```

Please check out the [examples](examples) to see how to use the library.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	u "github.com/rjNemo/underscore"
)

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
	// filter even numbers from the slice
	evens := u.Filter(numbers, func(n int) bool { return n%2 == 0 })
	// square every number in the slice
	squares := u.Map(evens, func(n int) int { return n * n })
	// reduce to the sum
	res := u.Reduce(squares, func(n, acc int) int { return n + acc }, 0)

	fmt.Println(res) // 120
}
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need at least `go1.18` for development. The project is shipped with a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) based on `go1.18`.

If you prefer local development, navigate to the [official
download page](https://go.dev/dl/) and install version `1.18` or beyond.

### Installing

First clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rjNemo/underscore.git
```

Install dependencies

```shell
go mod download
```

And that's it.

## Tests

To run the unit tests, you can simply run:

```shell
make test
```

## Functions

`underscore` provides many of functions that support your favorite functional helpers

### Collections

- `All`
- `Any`
- `Contains` (only numerics values at the moment)
- `Each`
- `Filter`
- `Flatmap`
- `Find`
- `Map`
- `Max`
- `Min`
- `Partition`
- `Reduce`

### Pipe

Calling `NewPipe` will cause all future method calls to return wrapped values. When you've finished the computation,
call `Value` to retrieve the final value.

Methods not returning a slice such as `Reduce`, `All`, `Any`, will break the `Chain` and return `Value` instantly.
